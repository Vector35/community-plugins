Please add my plugin to the repository.

Yes, I've read the instructions, especially the part about creating an [actual release](https://binary.ninja/2019/07/04/plugin-manager-2.0.html#5-create-a-release) and creating the tag. 

I either used the UI, or the `hub` command to create a _real_ release.
